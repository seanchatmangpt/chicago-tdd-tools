# Chicago TDD Tools Pattern Cookbook

Welcome to the Chicago TDD Tools Pattern Cookbook. This mdBook captures the living pattern language behind the framework. Inspired by Christopher Alexander's "A Pattern Language," each pattern documents a recurring problem and the high-leverage solution encoded in the framework. Patterns are organized across testing, architecture, and design themes so you can quickly discover what fits your current context.

Every pattern includes:

- **Context** – when the pattern applies
- **Problem** – the tension you are trying to resolve
- **Solution** – the structure that resolves the tension, with concrete code
- **Forces** – trade-offs the solution balances
- **Examples** – copy-pasteable Rust using Chicago TDD Tools
- **Related Patterns** – how the language connects

Use this cookbook as a field guide while building and testing Rust systems with Chicago TDD Tools.
