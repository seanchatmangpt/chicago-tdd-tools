## Testing Patterns (5)

| # | Pattern | Problem | Solution | Learn More |
|-|---------|---------|----------|-----------|
| 1 | **AAA Pattern** | Tests are unreadable | Structure into Arrange-Act-Assert | [→](testing-patterns/aaa-pattern.md) |
| 2 | **Error Path Testing** | Failures aren't tested | Test both success AND error paths | [→](testing-patterns/error-path-testing.md) |
| 3 | **Boundary Conditions** | Edge cases are missed | Systematically test limits | [→](testing-patterns/boundary-conditions.md) |
| 4 | **Resource Cleanup** | Tests leak resources | Automatic fixture cleanup | [→](testing-patterns/resource-cleanup.md) |

## Architecture Patterns (5)

| # | Pattern | Problem | Solution | Learn More |
|-|---------|---------|----------|-----------|
| 6 | **Generic Base Layer** | Code duplication | Extract generic abstractions | [→](architecture-patterns/generic-base.md) |

## Design Patterns (10)

| # | Pattern | Problem | Solution | Learn More |
|-|---------|---------|----------|-----------|
| 11 | **Zero-Cost Abstractions** | Abstractions are slow | Use generics, compile away overhead | [→](design-patterns/zero-cost-abstractions.md) |
| 12 | **Type Safety with GATs** | Type errors at runtime | Generic Associated Types | [→](design-patterns/type-safety-patterns.md) |
| 13 | **Sealed Traits** | API is too easy to misuse | Seal traits to prevent misuse | [→](design-patterns/sealed-traits.md) |
| 14 | **Compile-Time Validation** | Errors caught at runtime | Validate during compilation | [→](design-patterns/compile-time-validation.md) |
| 15 | **Type State Enforcement** | State machines are error-prone | Encode states in the type system | [→](design-patterns/type-state-pattern.md) |
| 16 | **Fixture Lifecycle** | Complex test setup | Manage with sealed traits | [→](design-patterns/fixture-lifecycle.md) |
| 17 | **Builder-Driven Test Data** | Building test data is tedious | Fluent builders for data | [→](design-patterns/builder-test-data.md) |
| 18 | **Timeout Defense** | Tests hang indefinitely | Timeout defense in depth | [→](design-patterns/timeout-defense.md) |
| 19 | **Feature Gate Slices** | Feature flags are unreliable | Slice-based feature gating | [→](design-patterns/feature-gating.md) |
| 20 | **Macro Pattern Enforcement** | Patterns are easy to violate | Use macros to enforce | [→](design-patterns/macro-enforcement.md) |

**Key**: These 10 patterns provide safety, performance, and design tools. Use during implementation.

## Pro Tips

💡 **Tip 1**: You don't need to learn all 20 patterns at once. Start with Testing (1-5), then add what you need.

💡 **Tip 2**: Patterns often appear in combinations. When you use Pattern 5 (Real Collaborators), you'll probably also use Pattern 17 (Builder Test Data).

💡 **Tip 3**: Look for patterns in the codebase you're reading. The more you see patterns, the better you'll understand them.

💡 **Tip 4**: Bookmark the [Decision Guide](choosing-your-pattern.md). You'll return to it when solving problems.
