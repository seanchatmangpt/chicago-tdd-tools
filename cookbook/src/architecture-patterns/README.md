# Architecture Patterns

Chicago TDD Tools is deliberately layered so teams can extend the framework without rewriting core functionality. The architecture patterns describe how modules compose, how extensions fit, and how the framework keeps behavior predictable across crates.

Use these patterns when building custom tooling on top of the framework or when evaluating how to contribute new modules upstream.
