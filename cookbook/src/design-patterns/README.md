# Design Patterns

These patterns codify the type-level and zero-cost techniques that make Chicago TDD Tools safe and fast. They explain how the framework encodes invariants, leverages Rust's compiler, and prevents misuse through types.

Use them when extending the framework or designing downstream APIs that should feel at home in the ecosystem.
