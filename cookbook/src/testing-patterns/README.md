# Testing Patterns

Tests are executable specifications. The Chicago TDD Tools testing patterns capture how to write fast, trustworthy, and expressive tests that verify observable behavior. Each pattern layers on the previous ones; together they reflect the AAA mindset, the insistence on real collaborators, and the bias toward fast failure.

Use these patterns when a test feels brittle, slow, or unclear. The language highlights which macro to reach for, how to structure the test body, and how to keep failures meaningful.
