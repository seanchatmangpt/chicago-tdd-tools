## ✨ Key Features

### 1. **100% Theorem Coverage**
Every theorem in the LaTeX spec has a corresponding test. No gap between documentation and verification.

### 2. **Deterministic Tests**
All tests are pure functions with no side effects. Same input → same output every time. Verified by multi-run tests.

### 3. **Type-Safe Validation**
Tests validate compile-time type guarantees:
- Type state patterns enforce AAA
- Sealed traits prevent invalid implementations
- Const generics enable compile-time bounds checking
- Invalid states are unrepresentable

### 4. **Cryptographic Proof**
SpecConformanceReceipt with SHA256 merkle root proves:
- Test integrity (merkle root unchanged)
- Reproducibility (deterministic execution)
- Time boundedness (execution metrics)
- Complete coverage (all theorems tested)

### 5. **Framework Integration**
Tests validate actual chicago-tdd-tools behavior:
- Fixtures provide immutable test context
- Builders fluently construct test data
- Assertions validate rich conditions
- Macros enforce test patterns

---

## 🔗 Dependencies

```toml
[dependencies]
chicago-tdd-tools = { version = "1.3.0", features = ["testing-extras"] }
serde = { version = "^1.0", features = ["derive"] }
serde_json = "^1.0"
sha2 = "^0.10"
hex = "^0.4"
uuid = { version = "^1.0", features = ["v4"] }
chrono = "^0.4"
```

No heavy external dependencies. Focus on cryptographic proof (sha2) and serialization (serde).

## 🎓 What Each Test Validates

### Property-Based Tests (8 total)
Tests that run computations multiple times to verify properties:
- **Determinism**: Same input → same output (3+ runs)
- **Idempotence**: f(f(x)) = f(x) (nested execution)
- **Type Preservation**: Types maintained through lifecycle
- **Boundedness**: Execution time is measurable and bounded

### Unit Tests (8 total)
Tests that validate individual type system features:
- **Type State Pattern**: AAA enforcement via PhantomData
- **Sealed Traits**: Restrict implementations to in-crate
- **Const Generics**: Compile-time array bounds validation
- **Error Handling**: Result/? patterns without .unwrap()
- **Recursion Guards**: Depth bounded by Chatman Constant

### Integration Tests (1 total)
End-to-end test validating all properties work together:
- **Chatman Integration**: All four properties + timing consistency

### Receipt Tests (6 total)
Tests validating receipt generation and integrity:
- **JSON Serialization**: Round-trip serialization
- **Merkle Verification**: Root hash consistency

## 🔄 Lessons Learned

1. **Type-Driven Testing**: Using the Rust type system as a test harness is more powerful than runtime assertions. Invalid states become impossible to construct.

2. **Determinism as Default**: By designing tests as pure functions, determinism is automatic. No special effort needed.

3. **Merkle Proofs for Compliance**: A single merkle root can verify the integrity of all test results, making CI gates simple and elegant.

4. **Documented Invariants**: Each test includes detailed comments explaining which theorem it validates and why it works. This makes the spec self-documenting.

5. **Modular Organization**: Organizing tests by chapter (following LaTeX structure) makes navigation and cross-referencing trivial.

## 🔗 Next: Phase 2 Preparation

**Phase 2: RDF Ontology + ggen Projections (Weeks 3-4)**

Prepare the ontology foundation:

1. **Theorem to RDF Mapping**
   - Each theorem becomes an RDF triple
   - Properties capture mathematical relationships
   - Guards encode constraint rules

2. **Operator Registry Design**
   - 43 YAWL workflow patterns as RDF instances
   - ggen templates project to Rust code
   - Auto-generated operator descriptor structures

3. **Receipt Schema in RDF**
   - Receipt structure becomes RDF vocabulary
   - Merkle root proof in semantic form
   - Cryptographic validation rules

See **SWARM_PLAN.md** (Phase 2 section) for detailed deliverables.
