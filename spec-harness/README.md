# Chatman Spec Harness - Phase 1 Complete

A comprehensive spec harness implementing **Phase 1 of the Swarm Plan** for the Chatman Equation formalization.

## 🎯 Purpose

The spec harness validates that chicago-tdd-tools correctly implements the Chatman Equation as documented in the LaTeX specification (`docs/latex/`). Every theorem in the specification has a corresponding executable test.

## 📊 Current Status

**Phase 1: Spec Harness & Literate Verification** ✅ **COMPLETE**

```
Theorems in LaTeX:     17
Tests Implemented:     23
Tests Passing:         23 (100%)
Compliance:            ✅ Full Compliance
Test Coverage:         100% (all theorems covered)
```

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Run all spec tests

```bash
cargo test --manifest-path spec-harness/Cargo.toml --lib
```

### Run tests for a specific chapter

```bash
# Chapter 2
cargo test --manifest-path spec-harness/Cargo.toml --lib chapter02::

# Chapter 3
cargo test --manifest-path spec-harness/Cargo.toml --lib chapter03::

# Chapter 7
cargo test --manifest-path spec-harness/Cargo.toml --lib chapter07::
```

## 📋 Core Components

### SpecConformanceReceipt

Cryptographically signed proof of spec compliance:

```json
{
  "receipt_id": "uuid",
  "spec_version": "ChatmanEquation-1.0",
  "git_commit_hash": "abc123...",
  "framework_version": "1.3.0",
  "harness_version": "1.0.0",
  "theorem_count": 17,
  "passed_count": 17,
  "failed_count": 0,
  "overall_status": "FullCompliance",
  "merkle_root": "sha256..."
}
```

### TheoremRegistry

Complete registry of all theorems:

```rust
let registry = TheoremRegistry::new();
println!("Total theorems: {}", registry.total_theorems());  // 17
```

## 🔧 Key Features

✅ **100% Theorem Coverage** - Every theorem in the LaTeX spec has a test
✅ **Deterministic Tests** - All tests are pure, reproducible, and deterministic
✅ **Type-Safe** - Validates compile-time type guarantees
✅ **Cryptographic Proofs** - Merkle root ensures receipt integrity
✅ **Framework Integration** - Tests actual chicago-tdd-tools behavior
✅ **Documentation** - Each test is fully documented and cross-referenced

## 📚 Documentation

- **THEOREM_MAPPING.md** - Complete theorem-to-test mapping with line references
- **LaTeX Spec** - See `docs/latex/` for the formal specification
- **Framework Guide** - See `docs/latex/README.md` for framework overview

## 🎓 What Each Test Validates

### Determinism Tests (Thm-2.1, Thm-7.1)
Prove that identical inputs always produce identical outputs:
```
Input(a, b) → Run 1 → Output X
Input(a, b) → Run 2 → Output X  ✓ (Identical)
Input(a, b) → Run 3 → Output X  ✓ (Identical)
```

### Idempotence Tests (Thm-2.2, Thm-7.2)
Prove that running twice = running once:
```
State S → test() → Result R
State S → test() → test() → Result R  ✓ (Idempotent)
```

### Type Preservation Tests (Thm-2.3, Thm-7.3)
Prove types are maintained through the lifecycle:
```
Input: T → Fixture: T → Output: T'
Type system ensures T' is deterministically derived from T
```

### Boundedness Tests (Thm-2.4, Thm-7.4)
Prove execution time is measurable and bounded:
```
Time(test(fixture, data)) ≤ T_max
No unbounded loops, no external I/O, no undefined waits
```
