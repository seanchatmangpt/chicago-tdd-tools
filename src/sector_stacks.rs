//! Sector-Grade Reference Stacks
//!
//! Production-grade implementations of the Chatman Equation in two sectors:
//! 1. Academic Publishing: Complete paper review workflow
//! 2. Enterprise Claims: Insurance claims processing with 100+ test cases
//!
//! Both demonstrate:
//! - Deterministic knowledge hooks
//! - Guard-based safety constraints
//! - Cryptographic receipt generation
//! - Multi-stage workflow validation
